***tez (तेज़ / تیز)***  means sharp, fast & active. This is a simple, to-the-point, library to make your pytorch training easy.

**Idea around tez is simple:**

- keep things as simple as possible
- make it as customizable as possible
- clean code
- faster prototyping
- production ready

Currently, tez supports cpu and gpu training. More coming soon!


## Installation

```console
$ pip install tez
```
